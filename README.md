pizza-parlour
=============

A toy project for ordering pizzas, using CakePHP.


Things I'd change or fix in a real project
===========================================

* Serve authentication over HTTPS
* Use JavaScript and CSS concatenation and minification
* Improve design
* Test on multiple devices including mobile
* Add some unit tests and integration tests
* Server-side validation that the same topping was not added multiple times
* I'd probably use a join table between pizzas and toppings so the limit of 3 can easily be changed
* Add nonce to submit form to prevent the same pizza being ordered twice by mistake
* Put orders screen behind an admin login
